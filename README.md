# Lyrics Generation Using Echo State Networks

---
This project uses a machine learning method, *Echo State Networks (ESNs)*, to generate lyrics. This project aims at finding out how *ESNs* are suited best for lyrics generation and does not intend to beat the state of the art lyrics generator or provide an alternative method to it.
